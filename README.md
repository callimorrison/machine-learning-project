# machine-learning-project
This repository is a demonstration of applying machine learning algorithms to a dataset. 

This is the final project of Coursera's IBM Machine Learning with Python course. The notebook supplies a dataset and allows the student to complete the machine learning models for K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression. The models are then evalauted through the Jaccard Index, the F1 Score, and Log Loss methods.
